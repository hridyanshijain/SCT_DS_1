# SCT_DS_1
🔹 Overview

This project is part of my Data Science Internship at Skillscraft Technology.
The task focuses on visualizing the distribution of categorical or continuous variables using bar charts and histograms.

🎯 Objective

To understand and represent data distributions effectively.

To visualize age and gender distributions in a population.

To gain insights on how different visualization techniques can uncover meaningful patterns.

📌 Key Highlights

✅ Used real-world dataset (population distribution)
✅ Implemented bar chart & histogram for analysis
✅ Learned how to differentiate between categorical vs continuous variables
✅ Improved data storytelling through visualization

📂 Dataset

A sample dataset containing population age distribution was used.

🛠️ Tools & Libraries

Python 🐍

Pandas

Matplotlib

Seaborn

📷 Example Output

Bar charts and histograms showing the population distribution by age groups and categories

🚀 This project gave me a strong foundation in data visualization techniques, which are essential in extracting insights and communicating results clearly.
